## Description

WebSocket client management can lead to memory leaks due to inadequate cleanup in error scenarios and unbounded client maps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Client cleanup implemented for all error scenarios
- [ ] Send channels properly closed in all paths
- [ ] Connection timeout handling added
- [ ] Periodic cleanup of stale connections
- [ ] Memory leak tests verify no goroutine leaks
- [ ] Resource monitoring and limits implemented
