## Description

Implement twerge's static code generation system to optimize TailwindCSS usage at build time. This will generate compact class mappings and enable efficient runtime performance by pre-processing class combinations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Twerge code generation integrated with build pipeline
- [ ] Static CSS class mappings generated
- [ ] Go code generation for class helpers
- [ ] Build-time optimization enabled
- [ ] Generated files properly ignored in version control
