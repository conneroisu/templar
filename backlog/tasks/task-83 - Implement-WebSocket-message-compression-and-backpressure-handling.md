## Description

Performance analysis identified WebSocket inefficiencies: no message compression for throughput optimization and missing graceful backpressure handling when channels are full. Current implementation drops messages when channels are full rather than implementing client prioritization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket message compression implemented
- [ ] Graceful backpressure handling with client prioritization
- [ ] No message drops under normal load conditions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 30% throughput improvement
