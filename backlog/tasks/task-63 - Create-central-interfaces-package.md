## Description

Missing key interfaces like ComponentRegistry, BuildPipeline, and FileWatcher causes tight coupling and difficult testing. Need central interfaces to improve architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create internal/interfaces package with core interfaces
- [ ] Define ComponentRegistry interface
- [ ] Add BuildPipeline interface for testability
- [ ] Create FileWatcher interface to reduce coupling
- [ ] Update packages to use interfaces instead of concrete types

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented central interfaces package with all core interfaces including ComponentRegistry, BuildPipeline, FileWatcher, and many others. Package created at internal/interfaces/ with comprehensive interface definitions for dependency injection and improved testability.
