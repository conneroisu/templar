## Description

The plugin system lacks proper security isolation and sandboxing mechanisms, creating potential security risks if malicious or poorly written plugins are loaded.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security validation for plugin loading and execution
- [ ] Inter-plugin communication limits and controls
- [ ] Resource access restrictions for plugins
- [ ] Security testing for plugin isolation
