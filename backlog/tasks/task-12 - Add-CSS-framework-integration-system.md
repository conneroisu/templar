## Description

Limited CSS framework support beyond basic Tailwind. Add comprehensive framework integration with setup commands and style guide generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Framework setup commands implemented (tailwind bootstrap bulma)
- [ ] CSS variable extraction and theming added
- [ ] Style guide generation functionality created
- [ ] Framework-specific optimizations implemented
- [ ] Integration with existing build system completed

## Implementation Plan

1. Research existing CSS framework plugins and analyze current Tailwind integration
2. Design flexible CSS framework plugin architecture with interfaces
3. Implement framework setup commands (tailwind, bootstrap, bulma, etc.)
4. Create CSS variable extraction and theming system
5. Add style guide generation functionality with framework-specific components
6. Implement framework-specific optimizations (purging, compilation, etc.)
7. Integrate with existing build pipeline and development server
8. Add CSS preprocessing support (SCSS, PostCSS)
9. Create framework-specific component templates and examples
10. Add comprehensive testing for all framework integrations

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive CSS framework integration system with the following features:

Successfully implemented comprehensive CSS framework integration system. The system now provides a solid foundation for advanced optimizations like twerge integration. Key components include flexible plugin architecture, TailwindCSS enhanced support, and comprehensive CLI commands. This work enables seamless integration with tools like twerge for intelligent class optimization and conflict resolution.
## Core Architecture
- **Flexible Plugin Architecture**: Created CSSFrameworkPlugin interface with comprehensive methods for setup, processing, theming, and style guide generation
- **Framework Manager**: Central management system for framework discovery, configuration, and lifecycle management  
- **Framework Registry**: Registration and discovery system for available CSS frameworks

## Framework Support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enhanced existing plugin with new interface, theme generation, style guide, and CLI integration
- **Bootstrap**: Complete plugin implementation with SCSS compilation, optimization, and component templates
- **Bulma**: Full plugin support with Sass compilation, theming system, and framework-specific optimizations

## CLI Commands
- **Framework Management**: , , 
- **Theming System**: ,   
- **Style Guide Generation**:  for comprehensive framework documentation

## Configuration Integration
- **Extended Config System**: Added CSSConfig with framework selection, optimization settings, and theming options
- **Automatic Detection**: Framework detection based on config files and project structure
- **Environment Integration**: Development server configuration with hot reload and CSS injection

## Key Features Implemented
- **Setup Commands**: Support for npm, CDN, and standalone installation methods
- **CSS Processing**: Framework-specific compilation, optimization, and purging
- **Variable Extraction**: Extract and customize CSS variables for theming
- **Style Guide Generation**: Automated documentation with component examples
- **Component Templates**: Framework-specific templ component templates
- **Hot Reload Support**: Development server integration with CSS injection
- **Security Hardening**: Path validation and input sanitization throughout

## Technical Implementation
- **Processing Pipeline**: CSS compilation, optimization, and hot reload integration
- **Class Detection**: Advanced class extraction with framework-specific heuristics  
- **Theme Generation**: Custom variable application and CSS generation
- **Template System**: Built-in component templates for each framework
- **Validation System**: Configuration and setup validation with detailed error reporting

The system provides a complete CSS framework integration solution with professional-grade tooling for modern web development workflows.
