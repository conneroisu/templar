## Description

Multiple implementations of validatePath and sanitization functions across packages create maintenance overhead and potential security vulnerabilities. Agent analysis found four different validatePath implementations and multiple sanitization functions scattered throughout the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single validation package with consolidated functions
- [ ] All packages use centralized validation
- [ ] Security tests validate consistency
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression
