## Description

Carol (UX Agent) identified HIGH-severity limitation where component preview lacks interactive capabilities. Developers cannot efficiently test components with different props or states without restarting the preview command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Interactive prop editor in component preview page
- [x] Real-time prop modification without restart
- [x] Component state toggling (loading error variants)
- [x] Multiple prop combinations saved and switchable
- [x] Search and filter components by name package props
- [x] Component categorization and organization

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing playground functionality and identify gaps
2. Enhance component list view with search and filtering
3. Add component categorization and organization features
4. Implement prop combination saving and switching
5. Add component state toggling for variants
6. Integrate all features into existing web interface
7. Test real-time functionality and WebSocket integration

## Implementation Notes

Successfully completed comprehensive interactive component prop editor enhancement with the following features:

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Search and Filtering**
   - Added real-time search input filtering components by name, package, and parameter names
   - Implemented category-based filtering with automatic component categorization
   - Categories include: UI Components, Layout, Forms, Data Display, Navigation, Feedback, and Other
   - Smart categorization based on component names and parameter patterns

2. **Component Categorization and Organization**  
   - Automatic categorization using intelligent pattern matching
   - Visual category badges with color coding for easy identification
   - Categories: UI (blue), Layout (purple), Form (green), Data (orange), Navigation (cyan), Feedback (red), Other (gray)
   - Category filter dropdown for easy filtering by component type

3. **Prop Combination Management**
   - Save and load custom prop combinations for each component
   - LocalStorage persistence for saved combinations
   - Dropdown selector to switch between default and saved combinations
   - Real-time prop synchronization when switching combinations
   - Quick save functionality with user-defined combination names

4. **Component State Management**
   - State selector with predefined states: Normal, Loading, Error, Disabled, Success  
   - Automatic prop mapping based on parameter names (e.g., loading, error, disabled, variant props)
   - Visual state indicators with appropriate styling
   - Real-time preview updates when state changes
   - Intelligent state-to-prop mapping for common patterns

5. **Real-time Interactive Editing**
   - Debounced prop updates for smooth performance  
   - Live preview rendering without server restarts
   - WebSocket integration for component change notifications
   - Immediate visual feedback on prop modifications
   - Quick prop editing directly in component cards

### Technical Implementation:

- **Enhanced UI Components**: Updated `enhanced_interface_ui.go` with comprehensive search, filtering, and state management
- **JavaScript Features**: Added 500+ lines of JavaScript for interactive functionality
- **CSS Styling**: New responsive styles for category badges, state indicators, and control elements  
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage integration for saving prop combinations across sessions
- **Performance Optimization**: Debounced updates and efficient DOM manipulation

### Files Modified:
- `internal/server/enhanced_interface_ui.go` - Core UI implementation with all new features
- Enhanced existing handlers in `internal/server/enhanced_web_interface.go` for backend support
- Integration with existing playground functionality and WebSocket system

### Key Benefits:
- Eliminates need to restart preview when testing different component configurations
- Provides efficient component discovery through search and categorization  
- Enables rapid prototyping with saved prop combinations
- Supports comprehensive component testing with state variants
- Maintains all configurations persistently across development sessions

The implementation provides a complete interactive development experience that significantly improves developer productivity when working with templ components.
