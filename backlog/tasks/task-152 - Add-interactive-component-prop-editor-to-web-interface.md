## Description

Carol (UX Agent) identified HIGH-severity limitation where component preview lacks interactive capabilities. Developers cannot efficiently test components with different props or states without restarting the preview command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interactive prop editor in component preview page
- [ ] Real-time prop modification without restart
- [ ] Component state toggling (loading error variants)
- [ ] Multiple prop combinations saved and switchable
- [ ] Search and filter components by name package props
- [ ] Component categorization and organization
