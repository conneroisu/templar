## Description

Replace weak MD5 hash usage with faster non-cryptographic alternatives and optimize hash generation patterns to improve performance and security

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace MD5 with xxHash or CRC32 for file change detection
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate file I/O operations in build pipeline
- [ ] Implement metadata-only change detection where possible
- [ ] Cache content hashes to avoid recomputation
- [ ] Add benchmarks for hash function performance
- [ ] Update security documentation
