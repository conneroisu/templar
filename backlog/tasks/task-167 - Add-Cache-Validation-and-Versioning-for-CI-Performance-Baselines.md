## Description

The CI/CD pipeline lacks cache validation and versioning for performance baselines, leading to potential corruption issues and incompatibility problems when baseline formats change.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cache integrity checks validate baseline correctness
- [ ] Baseline versioning handles schema evolution
- [ ] Corrupt cache detection prevents invalid baseline usage
- [ ] Cache invalidation occurs on format changes
- [ ] Baseline compatibility across CI environments is maintained
