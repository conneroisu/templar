## Description

Dave (Architecture Agent) identified CRITICAL architectural anti-pattern in adapters that violates Interface Segregation Principle and creates dangerous tight coupling. Adapters contain logic that swallows errors and hide interface mismatches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Remove all adapter types from adapters.go
- [x] Redesign interfaces to match concrete implementations
- [x] Update concrete types to implement interfaces directly
- [x] Remove adapter instantiation from DI container
- [x] Eliminate circular dependencies
- [x] Improve testability and mocking capabilities

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current adapter pattern usage and identify anti-patterns
2. Update concrete types (FileWatcher, ComponentScanner, BuildPipeline) to implement interfaces directly
3. Remove adapter instantiation from DI container and server code
4. Update all interface references to use concrete implementations
5. Remove adapters.go file completely
6. Add comprehensive interface compliance validation tests

## Implementation Notes

Successfully eliminated adapter anti-pattern by implementing direct interface compliance:

### Key Changes Made

1. **Updated FileWatcher (`internal/watcher/watcher.go`)**:
   - Modified struct fields to use interface types directly
   - Updated method signatures to match interface expectations
   - Added interface compliance verification: `var _ interfaces.FileWatcher = (*FileWatcher)(nil)`

2. **Updated ComponentScanner (`internal/scanner/scanner.go`)**:
   - Updated `GetRegistry()` method to return interface type
   - Added interface compliance verification: `var _ interfaces.ComponentScanner = (*ComponentScanner)(nil)`

3. **Updated BuildPipeline**: Already compliant from previous interface standardization work

4. **Removed Adapter Dependencies**:
   - **DI Container** (`internal/di/container.go`): Updated to use concrete types directly instead of adapter wrapping
   - **Server** (`internal/server/server.go`): Removed adapter imports and usage
   - **Watch Command** (`cmd/watch.go`): Eliminated adapter instantiation
   - **Interface Tests** (`tests/interfaces/interfaces_test.go`): Updated to use concrete types directly

5. **Complete Adapter Elimination**:
   - Removed `/internal/adapters/adapters.go` file completely
   - Removed empty `/internal/adapters/` directory
   - Eliminated all adapter imports throughout codebase

### Architecture Improvements Achieved

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Concrete types only implement methods they need
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Eliminated adapter wrapper responsibilities
- **Direct Interface Implementation**: No conversion or wrapping overhead
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time interface compliance verification
- **Memory Efficiency**: Removed adapter allocation overhead

### Validation Results

Created comprehensive compliance tests (`tests/integration/adapter_elimination_test.go`) that validate:
- ✅ All concrete types implement interfaces directly without adapters
- ✅ Interface segregation principle compliance
- ✅ No memory leaks with direct interface usage
- ✅ Full adapter package elimination

**Test Results**: All 5 interfaces (ComponentRegistry, FileWatcher, ComponentScanner, BuildPipeline, FileFilter) validate successfully with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

### Modified Files

- `internal/watcher/watcher.go` - Updated for direct interface compliance
- `internal/scanner/scanner.go` - Updated GetRegistry method signature  
- `internal/di/container.go` - Removed adapter instantiation
- `internal/server/server.go` - Direct concrete type usage
- `cmd/watch.go` - Eliminated adapter dependency
- `tests/interfaces/interfaces_test.go` - Updated to use concrete implementations
- `tests/integration/adapter_elimination_test.go` - Added compliance validation tests
- **Removed**: `internal/adapters/adapters.go` (entire adapter package eliminated)
