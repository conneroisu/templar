## Description

The build pipeline uses fixed worker pools which don't adapt to system load or build queue size, leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in varying workload scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dynamic worker pool sizing based on system load
- [ ] Build queue length monitoring and adjustment
- [ ] Performance metrics collection for worker utilization
- [ ] Graceful worker scaling up and down
- [ ] Integration with existing build pipeline architecture
