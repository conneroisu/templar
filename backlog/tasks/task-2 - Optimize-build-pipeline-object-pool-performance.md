## Description

Object pools show counterintuitive performance degradation (259,631 ns/op vs 216,334 ns/op without pools) and increased allocations. Investigation and optimization needed for memory efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Object pools show performance improvement over no pools
- [ ] Memory allocations reduced with pool usage
- [ ] Pool reset operations optimized
- [ ] Benchmark tests validate performance gains
