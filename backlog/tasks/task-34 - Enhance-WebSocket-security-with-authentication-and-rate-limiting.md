## Description

WebSocket connections lack proper authentication/authorization and have basic rate limiting, creating potential security vulnerabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement WebSocket authentication mechanism
- [ ] Add per-IP connection rate limiting
- [ ] Add configurable origin validation
- [ ] Implement connection lifecycle monitoring
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Test security against common WebSocket attacks
- [ ] Add connection timeout management
