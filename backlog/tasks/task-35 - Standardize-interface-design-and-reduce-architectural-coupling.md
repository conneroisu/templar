## Description

Implement consistent interface patterns across all packages and use dependency injection to reduce tight coupling and improve testability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define consistent interface patterns across all packages
- [ ] Implement interface-first design for major components
- [ ] Use dependency injection for external dependencies
- [ ] Replace service locator anti-pattern with configuration-driven registration
- [ ] Return interfaces from DI container instead of concrete types
- [ ] Add interface contract testing
