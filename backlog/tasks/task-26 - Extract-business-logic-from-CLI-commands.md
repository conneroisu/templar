## Description

CLI commands in /cmd/ package contain business logic mixed with CLI concerns, making business logic difficult to test independently

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Move business logic from /cmd/ to /internal/ packages
- [x] Keep commands as thin wrappers around business logic
- [x] Maintain all existing CLI functionality
- [x] Update command tests to focus on CLI concerns
- [x] Add unit tests for extracted business logic
- [x] Ensure proper error handling propagation
## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current CLI commands to identify business logic
2. Create service/business logic packages in internal/
3. Extract business logic from commands into services
4. Update CLI commands to be thin wrappers
5. Update tests to separate CLI vs business logic testing
6. Verify all functionality still works
7. Add comprehensive unit tests for business services

## Implementation Notes

Successfully extracted business logic from CLI commands into dedicated service packages:

Created service packages with business logic services extracted init command logic with InitService and build command logic with BuildService. Updated CLI commands to be thin wrappers. 

Key improvements: separation of concerns, improved testability, reusability, and maintainability. The refactoring follows clean architecture principles with clear boundaries between presentation and business logic layers.

Successfully completed extraction of business logic from CLI commands into dedicated service packages. 

**Architecture Improvements:**
- Created InitService, BuildService, and ServeService in internal/services/
- CLI commands now act as thin wrappers around business logic services
- Improved separation of concerns with clear boundaries between presentation and business logic layers

**Key Changes:**
1. **InitService**: Extracted project initialization logic including directory structure creation, config file generation, Go module setup, and example component creation
2. **BuildService**: Extracted build pipeline logic including component scanning, build execution, artifact cleanup, and production optimizations  
3. **ServeService**: Extracted development server logic including monitoring setup, dependency injection, and server lifecycle management

**Testing:**
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all service business logic (83 test cases)
- Updated CLI tests to focus on presentation concerns rather than business logic
- Service tests cover initialization, build processes, and server configuration

**Benefits:**
- **Reusability**: Business logic can now be used by other consumers
- **Testability**: Service logic can be unit tested independently from CLI framework
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Extensibility**: New interfaces enable dependency injection and mocking

All existing CLI functionality remains intact while achieving clean architecture principles.
