## Description

File watcher in internal/watcher/watcher.go has unbounded event accumulation and inefficient debouncing causing memory growth. Lines 316-327 append to slice without bounds checking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement bounded event queues with circular buffers
- [ ] Add periodic cleanup of old debounce state
- [ ] Use sync.Pool for event objects to reduce GC pressure
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant under sustained file changes
- [ ] All file watching functionality preserved

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze file watcher implementation for memory leak sources\n2. Implement bounded event queues with circular buffers\n3. Add periodic cleanup of old debounce state\n4. Use sync.Pool for event objects to reduce GC pressure\n5. Test memory usage patterns under sustained file changes

## Implementation Notes

Successfully fixed memory leaks in file watcher:\n\n1. Implemented bounded event queues with MaxPendingEvents limit (1000) to prevent unbounded growth\n2. Added object pools (eventPool, eventMapPool) for memory efficiency and reduced allocations\n3. Implemented periodic cleanup every 30 seconds to prevent slice capacity growth\n4. Added proper resource management in Stop() method with double-close protection\n5. Created comprehensive memory tests proving no memory leaks under sustained load\n\nMemory test results show actual memory decrease after 10k events, confirming effective leak prevention. Event queue properly bounded at exactly 1000 events maximum.
