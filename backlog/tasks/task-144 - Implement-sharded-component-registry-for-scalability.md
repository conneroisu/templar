## Description

Component registry uses simple map with global mutex limiting scalability for large component sets without sharding or partitioning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sharded registry implementation with multiple shards
- [ ] Component sharding strategy documented
- [ ] Performance improvement demonstrated on large component sets
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Dependency analysis optimized for sharded structure
- [ ] Registry scaling tests verify improvement
