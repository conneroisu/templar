## Description

Alice (Security Agent) identified a MEDIUM-severity race condition in cache size calculation that could lead to memory exhaustion. Concurrent cache updates can bypass size limits through calculation race conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement atomic operations for cache size calculations
- [ ] Add finer-grained locking for cache operations
- [ ] Race condition testing under concurrent load
- [ ] Memory exhaustion prevention validated
- [ ] Size tracking remains consistent under load
