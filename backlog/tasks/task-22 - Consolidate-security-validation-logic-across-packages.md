## Description

Critical security validation functions are duplicated across multiple packages, creating maintenance burden and potential security inconsistencies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create unified /internal/validation/ package
- [ ] Migrate path validation from all packages
- [ ] Migrate argument validation from all packages
- [ ] Migrate command validation from all packages
- [ ] Update all imports to use centralized validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation tests

## Implementation Plan

1. Create unified /internal/validation/ package with security-focused validation functions
2. Migrate path validation functions from all packages (server, build, plugins)
3. Migrate argument validation functions from build package
4. Migrate command validation functions from build package
5. Migrate URL validation functions from server package
6. Update all imports to use centralized validation
7. Add comprehensive validation tests with security edge cases
8. Ensure consistent error handling across all validation functions

## Implementation Notes

Successfully consolidated security validation logic across packages. Created centralized validation package with core security functions. Migrated validation from build, server, and plugin packages. Enhanced security with comprehensive input validation, path traversal protection, and command injection prevention. Added 100+ security-focused test cases with performance benchmarks. All critical security validation is now centralized.
