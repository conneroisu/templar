## Description

The performance system creates synthetic baselines for memory and allocation metrics instead of maintaining proper historical data, resulting in unreliable regression detection for these critical metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory usage baselines track historical data over time
- [ ] Allocation count baselines maintain proper statistical history
- [ ] Regression detection accuracy improves for memory metrics
- [ ] Statistical analysis uses real historical variance
- [ ] Baseline storage includes all metric types consistently
