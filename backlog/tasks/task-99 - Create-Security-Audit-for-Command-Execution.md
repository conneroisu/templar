## Description

Multiple locations in the codebase use exec.Command without comprehensive security validation, creating potential command injection vulnerabilities that need systematic review and hardening.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all exec.Command usage across the codebase
- [ ] Implement centralized command execution with security validation
- [ ] Add allowlisting for all external commands
- [ ] Replace exec.Command with exec.CommandContext for timeout controls
- [ ] Security testing for command injection prevention
