## Description

Address critical test coverage gaps including registry build failures, error handling coverage, and configuration validation issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fix registry component build failures
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling test suite
- [ ] Resolve configuration validation fuzz test failures
- [ ] Add comprehensive CLI testing coverage
- [ ] Implement registry concurrency and race condition testing
- [ ] Add error parser and HTML overlay generation testing

## Implementation Plan

1. Run tests to identify current failures and coverage gaps
2. Fix any registry component build failures
3. Analyze error handling test coverage and add missing tests
4. Debug and fix configuration validation fuzz test failures
5. Add comprehensive CLI command testing
6. Implement registry concurrency and race condition tests
7. Add missing error parser and HTML overlay tests
8. Run full test suite to verify all fixes
