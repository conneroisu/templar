## Description

Scanner validates every file path multiple times and calculates CRC32 hashes synchronously impacting performance on large codebases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Path validation caching implemented
- [ ] Asynchronous hash calculation added
- [ ] File operations optimized for large directories
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 50%+ improvement
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Scanner handles 1000+ components efficiently
