## Description

The codebase lacks consistent interface definitions leading to tight coupling between packages. This affects maintainability and testability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Central interfaces package created with core abstractions
- [ ] ComponentRegistry interface implemented and adopted
- [ ] BuildPipeline interface created and integrated
- [ ] FileWatcher interface standardized across usage
- [ ] Dependency injection updated to use interfaces instead of concrete types

## Implementation Notes

Implemented foundational interface-based architecture improvements: created central interfaces package with core abstractions (ComponentRegistry, ComponentScanner, BuildPipeline, etc.), updated scanner and build pipeline to use interfaces instead of concrete types, and established patterns for dependency injection. This reduces coupling between packages and improves testability. Full migration can be completed incrementally in future tasks.
