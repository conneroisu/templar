## Description

Large files like internal/build/pipeline.go (641 lines) and internal/server/server.go (595 lines) violate Single Responsibility Principle and are difficult to maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Split pipeline.go into separate files (pipeline.go cache.go compiler.go metrics.go)
- [ ] Refactor server.go to separate HTTP and WebSocket concerns
- [ ] Extract config validation from config.go into separate module
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Improved code organization and readability
