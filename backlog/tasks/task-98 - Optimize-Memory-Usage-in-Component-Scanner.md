## Description

The component scanner shows linear memory growth with large codebases (612KB for 1000 files) and could benefit from streaming processing and memory optimization techniques to handle large projects efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Streaming AST parsing implementation to reduce memory footprint
- [ ] Component metadata pre-filtering before expensive parsing
- [ ] Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for large codebase scenarios
