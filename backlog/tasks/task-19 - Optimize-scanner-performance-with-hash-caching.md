## Description

Scanner performance bottlenecks in parameter extraction and MD5 calculation. Implement hash caching and optimize parsing strategy for better performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hash caching implemented based on metadata
- [ ] Parameter extraction optimized
- [ ] Parsing strategy improved (manual first AST fallback)
- [ ] MD5 calculation optimized with caching
- [ ] Scanner performance benchmarks improved
