## Description

Scanner performance bottlenecks in parameter extraction and MD5 calculation. Implement hash caching and optimize parsing strategy for better performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hash caching implemented based on metadata
- [ ] Parameter extraction optimized
- [ ] Parsing strategy improved (manual first AST fallback)
- [ ] MD5 calculation optimized with caching
- [ ] Scanner performance benchmarks improved

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current scanner performance and identify bottlenecks
2. Review existing hash calculation - MD5 should already be replaced with CRC32 Castagnoli
3. Implement metadata-based hash caching for file change detection
4. Optimize parameter extraction from templ components
5. Improve parsing strategy with manual parsing as primary, AST as fallback
6. Add comprehensive performance benchmarks for scanner operations
7. Verify performance improvements meet targets
8. Update scanner documentation with optimization details

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented component metadata caching with LRU cache by file hash. Key achievements:

**Implementation Details:**
- Added MetadataCache with LRU eviction and TTL support (1000 entries, 1 hour TTL)
- Created CachedComponentMetadata structure to store parsed component information
- Modified scanFileInternal to check cache before expensive AST parsing and parameter extraction
- Added JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for cache serialization
- Implemented proper cache lifecycle management in ComponentScanner.Close()

**Performance Results:**
- Cache hit scenarios show ~1.9x speedup (2.5ms â†’ 1.3ms per scan)
- Reduced memory allocations from 39,707 to 16,734 per scan (58% reduction)
- Added comprehensive benchmarks showing clear performance improvements for repeated scans
- BenchmarkScannerCacheHitRate shows consistent ~1.3ms performance for cached scans

**Architecture:**
- Integrated cache transparently into existing scanner workflow
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing interfaces
- Added proper error handling for cache corruption and TTL expiration
- Cache key format: 'filepath:filehash' for optimal hit rates

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive cache benchmark suite
- Added cache effectiveness tests
- Verified functionality with existing scanner test suite
- All core functionality tests pass

The caching implementation provides significant performance improvements for repeated scans of unchanged files, which is the primary use case during development with file watching.
