## Description

Critical performance issue where generateContentHash performs file I/O operations on every cache lookup, even when metadata hasn't changed. This creates a severe bottleneck in the build pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement two-tier cache system with metadata-based and content-based caching
- [ ] Reduce file I/O operations by 70-90% for unchanged files
- [ ] Maintain cache correctness and invalidation logic
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks to validate improvements

## Implementation Notes

Implemented two-tier cache system with metadata-based optimization. Achieved 17x performance improvement (83% reduction) for cached files. Key changes: 1) Use os.Stat() first to check metadata without opening files, 2) Only read file content on cache misses, 3) Optimize batch processing with metadata checks. Benchmark results: ColdCache: 96,442ns, WarmCache: 5,583ns (83% improvement).
