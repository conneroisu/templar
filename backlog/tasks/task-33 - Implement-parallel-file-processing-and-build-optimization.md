## Description

Replace sequential file processing with parallel worker pools to improve build performance and add intelligent caching to reduce redundant operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement worker pool for parallel file scanning
- [ ] Use filepath.WalkDir for better performance
- [ ] Add AST parsing result caching
- [ ] Implement content-addressing with hash-only caching
- [ ] Use sync.Pool for cache entry objects
- [ ] Add build performance monitoring and metrics
