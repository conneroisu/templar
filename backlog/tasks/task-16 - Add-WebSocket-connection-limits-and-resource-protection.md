## Description

No connection limits on WebSocket endpoints could allow resource exhaustion attacks. Implement connection limits and resource protection mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket connection limits implemented
- [ ] Resource exhaustion protection added
- [ ] Connection cleanup mechanisms enhanced
- [ ] DoS protection validated through testing
- [ ] Performance maintained under normal loads
