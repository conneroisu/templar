## Description

Critical command injection vulnerability in internal/plugins/builtin/tailwind.go allows shell injection through CSS content and arbitrary file access. Lines 184, 268, 281, 287, 297 use unsafe exec.Command calls.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace all exec.Command calls with Go standard library functions [DONE]
- [ ] Add proper path validation for all file operations [DONE]
- [ ] Implement safe temporary file handling [DONE]
- [ ] All security tests pass [DONE]
- [ ] No shell commands used in plugin execution [DONE]
## Implementation Plan

1. Review current Tailwind plugin security fixes\n2. Complete any remaining vulnerability fixes\n3. Add comprehensive security validation\n4. Test all file operations for safety\n5. Update security tests

## Implementation Notes

Successfully completed critical security fixes in Tailwind plugin:\n\n1. Replaced unsafe exec.Command calls with Go standard library functions (os.ReadFile, os.WriteFile, os.Remove)\n2. Added comprehensive path validation with validatePath() function to prevent path traversal attacks\n3. Enhanced input sanitization with dangerous pattern detection\n4. Added security validation to all file operations\n5. Created comprehensive security tests covering command injection prevention and path traversal protection\n\nAll security tests pass and the plugin no longer uses shell commands for file operations. The implementation now follows security best practices with proper input validation, path sanitization, and safe file handling.
