## Description

Component scanner processes files sequentially which creates poor performance for large projects with hundreds of components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parallel file scanning implemented using worker pools
- [ ] Scanning performance improved by 300-400% for large codebases
- [ ] AST caching added to avoid re-parsing unchanged files
- [ ] File discovery optimized with concurrent directory walking
- [ ] Scanner memory usage optimized for large projects
