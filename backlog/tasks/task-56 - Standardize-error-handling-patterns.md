## Description

Inconsistent error handling across packages with mixed use of fmt.Errorf, errors.New, and enhanced errors. Need unified error handling approach for better maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create standardized error handling patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent error wrapping with context
- [ ] Update all packages to use unified error approach
- [ ] Improve error messages with actionable context
- [ ] All existing error functionality preserved

## Implementation Notes

Successfully standardized error handling patterns across the codebase. Key achievements: 1) Created comprehensive error pattern guidelines in internal/errors/patterns.go with service, file operation, network, CLI, and component patterns 2) Updated all service packages (BuildService, ServeService, InitService) to use standardized error creation functions 3) Fixed cleanGeneratedFiles logic and made cleanBuildArtifacts resilient to missing directories 4) Updated test expectations to match new standardized error messages - all service tests now passing 5) Verified build integrity with successful compilation. The error handling framework now provides consistent, structured error messages with component context, error codes, and appropriate categorization for security, validation, and operational errors. This establishes a solid foundation for maintainable and debuggable error handling across the entire application.
