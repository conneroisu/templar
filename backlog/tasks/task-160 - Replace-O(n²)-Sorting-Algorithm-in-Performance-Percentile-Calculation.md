## Description

The performance monitoring system uses insertion sort for percentile calculation, creating O(n²) complexity that severely impacts scalability with large metric datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Percentile calculation uses O(n log n) sorting algorithm
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized with object pooling for sorted arrays
- [ ] Benchmarks demonstrate 100x performance improvement for large datasets
- [ ] Lock contention is eliminated during percentile calculation
- [ ] Statistical accuracy is maintained with optimized algorithm

## Implementation Plan

1. Profile current percentile calculation performance with varying dataset sizes
2. Replace insertion sort with Go's sort.Float64s() implementation
3. Implement object pooling for temporary sorted arrays to reduce allocations
4. Add streaming percentile algorithms (P² algorithm) for O(1) space complexity
5. Benchmark performance improvements across different data sizes
6. Validate statistical accuracy is maintained
7. Update concurrent access patterns to reduce lock contention
