## Description

Current packages have inconsistent interface design and high coupling to concrete types. Create central interfaces package to improve testability and reduce coupling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Central interfaces package created in /internal/interfaces/
- [ ] Core interfaces defined for ComponentRegistry and BuildPipeline
- [ ] Packages updated to depend on interfaces not concrete types
- [ ] Interface segregation principle applied
- [ ] Testability improved through interface abstractions
