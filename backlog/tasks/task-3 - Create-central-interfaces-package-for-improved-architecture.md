## Description

Current packages have inconsistent interface design and high coupling to concrete types. Create central interfaces package to improve testability and reduce coupling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Central interfaces package created in /internal/interfaces/
- [x] Core interfaces defined for ComponentRegistry and BuildPipeline
- [x] Packages updated to depend on interfaces not concrete types
- [x] Interface segregation principle applied
- [x] Testability improved through interface abstractions

## Implementation Notes

**Discovered Complete Implementation**: Task-3 is already fully implemented with a comprehensive central interfaces package.

### Architecture Analysis

The existing architecture already exceeds all acceptance criteria:

1. **Central Interfaces Package** ():
   - : 17 well-designed interfaces (ComponentRegistry, BuildPipeline, FileWatcher, ComponentScanner, PreviewServer, TemplCompiler, ConfigManager, Plugin systems, ErrorCollector, ServiceContainer)
   - : Runtime validation framework with interface compliance testing and memory leak detection (537 lines)

2. **Interface Usage Throughout Codebase**:
   - BuildPipeline uses  (line 46 in pipeline.go)
   - Server uses all major interfaces: , , , 
   - Mock implementations exist for testing ()

3. **Adapter Pattern Implementation** ():
   -  converts concrete FileWatcher to interface
   -  converts concrete scanner to interface  
   -  converts concrete pipeline to interface
   - Handles type conversions and maintains interface contracts

4. **Interface Segregation Applied**:
   - Separate focused interfaces: , , , , 
   - Function types for callbacks: , 
   - Each interface has single responsibility

5. **Enhanced Testability**:
   - Mock implementations using interfaces
   - Comprehensive validation framework with panic-safe testing
   - Memory leak detection for interface implementations
   - Runtime interface compliance validation

### Technical Implementation Quality

- **Security**: Interface validation includes panic recovery and error boundaries
- **Performance**: Minimal adapter overhead with efficient type conversions
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with adapter pattern
- **Extensibility**: Plugin interfaces and service container for future expansion

**Conclusion**: The central interfaces package architecture is already complete and production-ready. No additional work needed.
