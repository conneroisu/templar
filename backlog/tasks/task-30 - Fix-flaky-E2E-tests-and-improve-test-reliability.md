## Description

E2E workflow tests have race conditions and poor fallback logic causing unreliable CI/CD pipeline execution

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement proper server readiness checks
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- [ ] Fix race conditions in server startup
- [ ] Add deterministic test setup procedures
- [ ] Implement timeout management for tests
- [ ] Add test isolation improvements
- [ ] Ensure consistent test results across CI runs
