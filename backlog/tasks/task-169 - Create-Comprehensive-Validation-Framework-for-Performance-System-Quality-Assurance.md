## Description

Establish a thorough validation framework to ensure the performance regression detection system meets enterprise-grade quality standards across security, performance, and reliability dimensions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security validation covers all attack vectors identified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate system efficiency under load
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Regression prevention tests ensure no functionality degradation
- [ ] Documentation validation ensures operational readiness

## Implementation Plan

1. Create security validation test suite covering path traversal and command injection
2. Implement performance benchmarks for algorithmic efficiency validation
3. Add integration tests for end-to-end CI/CD workflow validation
4. Create operational validation procedures for documentation and monitoring
5. Establish automated validation pipelines for continuous quality assurance
6. Add regression prevention tests to ensure no functionality degradation
7. Create validation reporting and metrics collection framework
