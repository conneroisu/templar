## Description

The performance regression detection system lacks security testing coverage despite containing file operations, command execution, and path handling that require thorough security validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security test suite covers all file operations
- [ ] Command injection prevention tests validate git operations
- [ ] Path traversal tests cover baseline directory operations
- [ ] Input validation tests handle malicious benchmark data
- [ ] Fuzz testing validates parser security against malformed input
