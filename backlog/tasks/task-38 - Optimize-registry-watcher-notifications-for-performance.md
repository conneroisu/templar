## Description

Registry watcher notifications use synchronous blocking operations that can cause 5-second+ delays with many watchers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement async notification system with timeouts
- [ ] Add circuit breaker for slow watchers
- [ ] Implement notification buffering mechanism
- [ ] Add drop policies for unresponsive watchers
- [ ] Benchmark performance with 100+ watchers
- [ ] Add watcher health monitoring
- [ ] Maintain notification ordering guarantees
