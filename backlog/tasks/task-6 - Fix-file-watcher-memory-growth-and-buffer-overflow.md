## Description

File watcher shows linear memory growth (86KB â†’ 3MB) and queue overflow issues under concurrent operations. Optimize memory usage and buffer management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory growth eliminated or made logarithmic
- [ ] Queue overflow issues resolved
- [ ] Event buffer sizing optimized for scale
- [ ] Memory pooling implemented for ChangeEvent structs
- [ ] Batch processing added for multiple file events
