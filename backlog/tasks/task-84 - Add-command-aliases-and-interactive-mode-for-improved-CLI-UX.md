## Description

User experience analysis identified CLI usability issues: no command aliases for frequently used commands, verbose command names requiring long typing, and missing interactive command selection for better onboarding experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Short aliases implemented for all major commands (s=serve p=preview etc)
- [ ] Interactive command selection menu implemented
- [ ] Alias documentation added to help text
- [ ] User testing shows 50% faster command execution
