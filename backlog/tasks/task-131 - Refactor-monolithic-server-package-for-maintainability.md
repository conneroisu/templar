## Description

Server package contains 601 lines with multiple responsibilities mixing HTTP routing, WebSocket management, middleware setup, and business logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server.go split into focused modules (HTTP
- [ ] WebSocket
- [ ] middleware)
- [ ] WebSocket functionality extracted to dedicated package
- [ ] HTTP handlers separated by concern
- [ ] Middleware package with composable functions created
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Test coverage maintained

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored monolithic server package into focused modules. WebSocket functionality extracted to internal/websocket/, HTTP handlers separated into focused files, middleware package created with composable functions, and service orchestration separated. All functionality preserved with comprehensive test coverage maintained.
