## Description

Eve (Testing Agent) identified insufficient test coverage in configuration (21.6%) and critical security validation paths. Missing tests create production vulnerability risks in path traversal and command injection prevention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Achieve >90% test coverage for config package
- [ ] Add comprehensive security validation tests
- [ ] Test all path traversal prevention mechanisms
- [ ] Test command injection prevention thoroughly
- [ ] Add property-based testing for input validation
- [ ] Security fuzz tests pass consistently
- [ ] Error path testing for all validation functions
