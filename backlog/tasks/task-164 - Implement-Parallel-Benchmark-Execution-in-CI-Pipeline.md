## Description

The CI/CD pipeline executes benchmarks sequentially, causing significant delays in build times and limiting scalability as the number of benchmarks grows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmarks execute in parallel across multiple packages
- [ ] CI execution time reduces by 60-70% for typical workloads
- [ ] Resource isolation prevents benchmark interference
- [ ] Result aggregation maintains statistical accuracy
- [ ] Failed benchmark isolation doesn't block other benchmarks
