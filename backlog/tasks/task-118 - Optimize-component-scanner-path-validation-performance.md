## Description

High-priority performance issue where path validation performs expensive operations (filepath.Abs, os.Getwd) for every file during directory scans, causing 50-70% performance overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cache current working directory for path validation
- [ ] Implement path prefix checking with pre-computed absolute CWD
- [ ] Reduce file system calls during validation
- [ ] Achieve 50-70% faster directory scanning
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks to validate improvements
- [ ] Maintain security validation effectiveness
