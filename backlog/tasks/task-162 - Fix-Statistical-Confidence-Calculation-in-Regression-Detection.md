## Description

The regression detection system uses oversimplified statistical confidence calculation that produces mathematically incorrect confidence levels, leading to unreliable regression assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Statistical confidence uses proper t-distribution for small samples
- [ ] Z-score to confidence conversion is mathematically accurate
- [ ] Multiple comparison correction prevents false positives
- [ ] Confidence intervals are properly calculated for regression thresholds
- [ ] Statistical methods are validated against known benchmarks

## Implementation Notes

Replaced mathematically flawed confidence calculation with rigorous statistical implementation featuring proper t-distribution for small samples, Bonferroni multiple comparison correction, confidence intervals, and effect size analysis
