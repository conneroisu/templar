## Description

Project lacks LICENSE file creating legal uncertainty and missing CONTRIBUTING.md impacts contributor onboarding experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Appropriate LICENSE file added to repository
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md file created with comprehensive guidelines
- [x] Code style guidelines documented
- [x] Pull request process defined
- [x] Issue reporting templates created
- [x] Development environment setup documented in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Implementation Plan

1. Research appropriate open-source license (likely MIT or Apache 2.0)
2. Create LICENSE file with selected license
3. Create comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
4. Add issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
5. Document code style guidelines and PR process
6. Update README if needed to reference contribution guidelines

## Implementation Notes

Task was already complete when reviewed. The project has:
- MIT License file with proper copyright attribution
- Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines, code style, testing, security considerations, and PR process
- Complete set of GitHub issue templates: bug_report.yml, feature_request.yml, documentation.yml, and security_report.yml
- All documentation is thorough and follows best practices for open source projects

No additional changes were needed as all acceptance criteria were already satisfied.
