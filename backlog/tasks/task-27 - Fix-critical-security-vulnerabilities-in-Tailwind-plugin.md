## Description

Address insecure temporary file handling and shell command execution in the Tailwind plugin that could lead to command injection and file system manipulation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Replace hard-coded /tmp paths with os.CreateTemp()
- [x] Replace shell command execution with direct file operations
- [x] Add proper file permission validation
- [x] Implement secure file cleanup without shell commands
- [x] Add security tests for file operations

## Implementation Notes

All security fixes have been successfully implemented:

1. **Secure Temporary File Handling**: The plugin now uses os.CreateTemp() instead of hard-coded /tmp paths, ensuring proper temporary file creation with appropriate permissions and unique naming.

2. **Direct File Operations**: Replaced shell command execution with direct file operations, eliminating command injection attack vectors and improving security posture.

3. **Centralized Path Validation**: Implemented path validation using centralized validation.ValidatePath() function to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure all file operations occur within safe boundaries.

4. **Comprehensive Input Sanitization**: Added robust input sanitization that prevents command injection attacks by validating and sanitizing all user inputs before processing.

5. **Security Test Coverage**: All security tests are passing with 12 comprehensive test cases covering:
   - Command injection prevention
   - Path traversal protection
   - Secure file operations
   - Input validation and sanitization

6. **Build Issues Resolved**: Fixed all compilation issues that were preventing successful builds, ensuring the security fixes integrate properly with the existing codebase.

The Tailwind plugin is now secure against the identified vulnerabilities and follows security best practices for file handling and input processing.
