## Description

The configuration loading system has a massive function with 222 lines that violates single responsibility principle and is difficult to test and maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configuration loading refactored into builder pattern
- [ ] Validation separated from loading logic
- [ ] Individual configuration components made testable
- [ ] Viper workarounds isolated and documented
- [ ] Configuration complexity reduced for new users with tiered approach

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored configuration system using builder pattern. Created ConfigBuilder with progressive complexity tiers (Basic, Development, Production, Enterprise) and separated validation from loading logic. Builder pattern implemented in internal/config/builder.go with fluent interface for configuration construction.
