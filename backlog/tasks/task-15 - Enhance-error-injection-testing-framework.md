## Description

Current error injection framework limited to basic scenarios. Expand to include system-level failures and resource constraints for comprehensive testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System-level failure simulation added
- [ ] Resource constraint testing implemented
- [ ] Filesystem and network error injection created
- [ ] Memory and disk space exhaustion scenarios tested
- [ ] Enhanced error injection integrated with existing tests
