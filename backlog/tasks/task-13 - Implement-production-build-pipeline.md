## Description

No production-optimized builds available. Add production build pipeline with asset bundling minification and optimization for deployment readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production build command implemented
- [ ] Asset bundling and minification added
- [ ] Static site generation support created
- [ ] Build optimization for production validated
- [ ] Deployment-ready artifacts generated

## Implementation Plan

1. Research existing build system and identify production optimization gaps
2. Design production build pipeline architecture with asset bundling
3. Implement production build command with optimization flags
4. Add static site generation support for deployable artifacts
5. Create asset minification and bundling system
6. Implement production-specific configuration and environment variables
7. Add deployment artifact generation (Docker, static files, etc.)
8. Create build validation and quality checks
9. Add comprehensive testing for production builds
10. Document production build and deployment workflows
