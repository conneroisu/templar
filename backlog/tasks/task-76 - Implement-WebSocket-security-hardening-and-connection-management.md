## Description

WebSocket implementation lacks proper connection limits, timeout handling, and authentication mechanisms, creating potential DoS vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection limits implemented to prevent DoS attacks
- [ ] WebSocket authentication system added for production use
- [ ] Connection timeout and cleanup mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting added for WebSocket messages
- [ ] Resource management improved to prevent memory leaks
- [ ] Security tests added for WebSocket attack vectors

## Implementation Notes

Enhanced WebSocket security with comprehensive protection measures: added connection limits (max 100 concurrent), implemented rate limiting (60 messages/minute per client), added connection timeout handling (5 minute inactivity), improved DoS protection with proper connection counting, and enhanced activity tracking for connection lifecycle management. The security enhancements prevent resource exhaustion attacks and provide proper client management.
