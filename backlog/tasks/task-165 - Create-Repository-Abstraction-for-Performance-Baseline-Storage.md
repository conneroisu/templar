## Description

The performance system directly handles file I/O operations for baseline storage, violating separation of concerns and limiting extensibility for different storage backends.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Repository interface abstracts baseline storage operations
- [ ] File system implementation maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] Mock repository enables comprehensive testing
- [ ] Storage operations are properly abstracted from business logic
- [ ] Multiple storage backends can be implemented without core changes
