## Description

The current change detection system uses CRC32 on full file content, which can be slow for large files. A hierarchical hashing approach would improve performance significantly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hierarchical hashing with metadata and content sampling
- [ ] Fast hash generation for large template files
- [ ] Integration with existing build cache system
- [ ] Performance benchmarks comparing hash strategies
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for hash collisions
