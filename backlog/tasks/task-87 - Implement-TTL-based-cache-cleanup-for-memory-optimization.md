## Description

Performance analysis identified that cache TTL checks only happen on access, leading to potential memory bloat from expired entries. Cache could benefit from proactive background cleanup to maintain optimal memory usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Background TTL cleanup goroutine implemented
- [ ] Proactive cache entry expiration and cleanup
- [ ] Memory usage optimized with configurable cleanup intervals
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 20% memory reduction under load
