## Description

The performance system performs individual file operations for each baseline update, creating O(n) file operations that significantly impact performance with large numbers of benchmarks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Baseline updates use atomic batch operations
- [ ] File I/O operations scale to O(1) regardless of benchmark count
- [ ] Write-ahead logging ensures consistency during updates
- [ ] Performance improves by 10-100x for typical workloads
- [ ] Error recovery maintains baseline integrity during failures
