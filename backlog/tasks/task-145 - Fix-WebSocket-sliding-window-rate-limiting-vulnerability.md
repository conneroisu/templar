## Description

Alice (Security Agent) identified a MEDIUM-severity vulnerability where the current rate limiting implementation allows burst attacks at window boundaries. The current minute-based window reset allows attackers to send maximum messages, wait for reset, and repeat.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement sliding window rate limiting algorithm
- [ ] Add exponential backoff for repeated violations
- [ ] Rate limiting persists across window boundaries
- [ ] Validate fix with concurrent load testing
- [ ] Security tests verify no window boundary bypass
