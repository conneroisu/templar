## Description

File scanning performs sequential processing causing 10x slower scanning for large codebases with 1000+ files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement worker pool for parallel file processing
- [ ] Add configurable concurrency limits
- [ ] Optimize MD5 hashing for concurrent access
- [ ] Maintain file processing order consistency
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring during parallel scanning
