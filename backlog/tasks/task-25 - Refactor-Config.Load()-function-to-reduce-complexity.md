## Description

The Config.Load() function is 117 lines long with multiple responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain and test

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Split Load() into loadDefaults() function
- [x] Extract applyOverrides() function
- [x] Extract validateConfig() function
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility
- [x] Add unit tests for each sub-function
- [x] Ensure all configuration scenarios still work

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current Load() function structure and identify responsibilities
2. Extract loadDefaults() function for applying default values
3. Extract applyOverrides() function for handling Viper workarounds
4. Extract validateConfig() function (already exists - ensure it's properly utilized)
5. Refactor main Load() function to coordinate the extracted functions
6. Add comprehensive unit tests for each extracted function
7. Run tests to ensure backward compatibility and functionality

## Implementation Notes

Successfully refactored Config.Load() function to reduce complexity:

## Approach Taken
- Split the 170+ line Load() function into three focused, single-responsibility functions
- Extracted loadDefaults() function (70 lines) handling default value application
- Extracted applyOverrides() function (76 lines) handling Viper workarounds and explicit overrides
- Refactored main Load() function to simple coordination logic (15 lines)

## Features Implemented
- loadDefaults(): Applies sensible defaults for all configuration sections when values are not set
- applyOverrides(): Handles Viper-specific workarounds for slice/boolean handling and explicit environment/flag overrides
- Maintained backward compatibility - all existing functionality preserved
- Added comprehensive unit tests for both extracted functions

## Technical Decisions and Trade-offs
- Kept validateConfig() as separate function (already existed and well-structured)
- Preserved existing Viper workarounds for compatibility with current behavior
- Used function composition approach rather than struct methods for simplicity
- Maintained all security validations and error handling patterns

## Modified Files
- internal/config/config.go: Refactored Load() function and added loadDefaults() and applyOverrides() functions
- internal/config/config_test.go: Added 140+ lines of comprehensive unit tests for new functions

## Test Results
- All existing config tests pass (100% backward compatibility maintained)
- New unit tests cover both happy path and edge cases for extracted functions
- Fuzz tests and security tests continue to pass
