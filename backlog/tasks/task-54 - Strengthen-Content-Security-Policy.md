## Description

CSP configuration in internal/server/security.go uses unsafe directives 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' that weaken XSS protection. Need to implement nonce-based CSP for production security.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' from production CSP
- [ ] Implement nonce-based inline script/style handling
- [ ] Add CSP violation reporting endpoint
- [ ] All web functionality works without unsafe directives
- [ ] Security tests validate CSP effectiveness

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current CSP configuration in internal/server/security.go\n2. Remove unsafe directives ('unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval')\n3. Implement nonce-based CSP for inline scripts and styles\n4. Add CSP violation reporting endpoint\n5. Test all web functionality without unsafe directives\n6. Update security tests to validate CSP effectiveness

## Implementation Notes

Successfully strengthened Content Security Policy:\n\n1. Implemented nonce-based CSP to replace unsafe directives ('unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval')\n2. Added cryptographically secure nonce generation (16 bytes, base64 encoded)\n3. Enhanced SecurityMiddleware to inject nonces into request context\n4. Updated ProductionSecurityConfig to use secure CSP without unsafe directives\n5. Added CSP violation reporting endpoint at /api/csp-violation-report\n6. Created comprehensive test suite validating nonce generation, CSP headers, and security effectiveness\n\nProduction CSP now uses nonces for inline scripts/styles instead of unsafe directives, significantly strengthening XSS protection while maintaining functionality.
