## Description

The build pipeline lacks circuit breaker patterns for handling repeated failures, which can lead to resource exhaustion and cascading failures when components fail to build repeatedly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Circuit breaker implementation for build operations
- [ ] Configurable failure threshold and reset timeout
- [ ] Integration with existing build pipeline
- [ ] Metrics collection for circuit breaker state
- [ ] Documentation and examples for circuit breaker usage
