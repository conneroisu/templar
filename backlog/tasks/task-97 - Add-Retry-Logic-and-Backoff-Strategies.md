## Description

The system lacks systematic retry mechanisms for transient failures in file I/O, build operations, and network connections, leading to unnecessary failures that could be resolved with proper retry logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implementation for file I/O operations
- [ ] Build operation retry with intelligent failure detection
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection logic for clients
- [ ] Error classification to distinguish retry-able vs permanent failures
