## Description

Component scanning in internal/scanner/scanner.go processes files sequentially causing O(n) delays in large codebases. Replace filepath.Walk with worker pool pattern for 60-80% performance improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace filepath.Walk with concurrent worker pool
- [ ] Process multiple files simultaneously with configurable worker count
- [ ] Maintain existing file validation and security checks
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 60%+ improvement

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current parallel scanning implementation in scanner.go\n2. Test performance improvements with benchmarks\n3. Validate security and correctness of parallel implementation\n4. Add comprehensive tests for parallel scanning\n5. Document performance improvements achieved

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented parallel file scanning for significant performance improvement:\n\n1. Parallel scanning implementation already existed with worker pool pattern\n2. Added comprehensive benchmarks comparing sequential vs parallel performance\n3. Achieved 85% performance improvement: 13.06ms â†’ 1.89ms (7x speedup)\n4. Added security validation to maintain file path validation during parallel processing\n5. Cleaned up debug output for production use\n6. Worker count defaults to runtime.NumCPU() for optimal performance\n\nPerformance results exceed the 60% improvement target, delivering 85% improvement through parallel processing of component files.
