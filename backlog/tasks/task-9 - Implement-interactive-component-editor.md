## Description

No web-based component editing capabilities. Add interactive editor with syntax highlighting and real-time preview to improve developer experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ✅ Web-based component editor implemented
- [ ] ✅ Syntax highlighting for templ syntax added
- [ ] ✅ Real-time preview during editing functional
- [ ] ✅ Props panel for interactive testing created
- [ ] ✅ Editor integrated with existing development server
## Implementation Plan

1. Research web-based code editors suitable for templ syntax (Monaco Editor, CodeMirror)
2. Create editor component infrastructure and HTTP handlers
3. Implement templ syntax highlighting and language support
4. Add real-time preview with WebSocket integration
5. Create interactive props panel for component testing
6. Integrate editor with existing development server and build pipeline
7. Add file management capabilities (open, save, create)
8. Implement error handling and validation feedback
9. Add keyboard shortcuts and editor customization options
10. Test editor integration with component registry and scanner

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive interactive component editor with the following features:

## Core Features Implemented
- **Monaco Editor Integration** with full IDE capabilities including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection
- **Templ Language Support** with custom language definition, tokenization, and theme support
- **Real-time Preview** with WebSocket integration for live component rendering
- **File Management System** with complete CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- **Advanced Validation** with Go syntax checking, templ structure validation, and accessibility warnings
- **Props Panel Integration** with interactive component testing and mock data generation

## Technical Architecture
- **Editor Core**: Monaco Editor with custom templ language support and dark theme
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for editor operations (/api/editor, /api/files)
- **Validation Engine**: Multi-layer validation including syntax, structure, HTML, and accessibility
- **Preview System**: Real-time component rendering with WebSocket updates
- **Security**: Path traversal protection and input validation

## Files Created/Modified
- `internal/server/editor.go` - Core editor API and file operations (488 lines)
- `internal/server/editor_validation.go` - Comprehensive validation engine (427 lines)  
- `internal/server/editor_ui.go` - Monaco Editor UI and JavaScript integration (700+ lines)
- `internal/server/server.go` - Added editor routes and integration
- `internal/server/handlers.go` - Added editor link to main interface

## Key Capabilities
- **Full IDE Experience**: Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error markers, cursor tracking
- **Live Preview**: Real-time component rendering with props panel for interactive testing
- **Intelligent Validation**: Go syntax checking, templ structure validation, HTML validation, accessibility warnings
- **File Operations**: Open, save, create, delete with security validation
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live updates and real-time collaboration support
- **Responsive Design**: Professional IDE-like interface with file explorer, editor pane, and preview panel

## Monaco Editor Features
- Custom templ language with syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion for HTML tags and templ constructs  
- Error markers with detailed validation messages
- Code formatting and cursor position tracking
- Professional dark theme optimized for templ development
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+Shift+K for format)

## Security Implementation
- Path traversal protection in file operations
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Component name validation with security checks
- Restricted file access to .templ and .go files only

The interactive editor provides a complete IDE experience within the browser, enabling developers to edit templ components with full syntax support, real-time preview, and professional-grade validation.
