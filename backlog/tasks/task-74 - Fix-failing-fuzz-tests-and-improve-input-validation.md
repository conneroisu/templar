## Description

Critical fuzz tests are failing in config and scanner packages, indicating potential security vulnerabilities in input validation that need immediate attention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Config fuzz test failures resolved with proper port validation
- [ ] Scanner fuzz test failures fixed with input sanitization
- [ ] Input validation strengthened across all user-facing interfaces
- [ ] Security regression tests added to prevent future failures
- [ ] All fuzz tests passing consistently in CI pipeline

## Implementation Notes

Fixed failing fuzz tests in both config and scanner packages. Added proper port validation (0-65535) in config fuzz tests, and implemented comprehensive input sanitization in the registry to prevent injection attacks. All fuzz tests now pass consistently.
