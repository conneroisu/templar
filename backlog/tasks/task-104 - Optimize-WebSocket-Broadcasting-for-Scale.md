## Description

The current WebSocket broadcasting implementation doesn't scale efficiently for large numbers of concurrent clients and needs optimization for better performance and resource utilization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parallel broadcasting implementation with worker pools
- [ ] Connection pooling and reuse strategies
- [ ] Broadcasting efficiency improvements for 1000+ clients
- [ ] Memory optimization for large client counts
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and scalability testing
