## Description

DI container uses reflection and string-based lookups impacting performance in hot paths without caching of resolved service graphs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service resolution caching implemented
- [ ] Reflection usage optimized for performance
- [ ] String map lookups minimized in hot paths
- [ ] Service graph resolution cached
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show measurable improvement
- [ ] Memory usage for DI container optimized
