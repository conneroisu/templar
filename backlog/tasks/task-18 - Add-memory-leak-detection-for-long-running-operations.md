## Description

No long-running memory leak detection in place. Implement memory profiling and leak detection for integration tests and extended operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory profiling added to integration tests
- [ ] Goroutine leak detection implemented
- [ ] Long-running operation monitoring created
- [ ] Memory leak prevention validated
- [ ] Resource tracking enhanced
