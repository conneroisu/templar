## Description

File watcher can experience memory growth under high-frequency changes due to unbounded event accumulation and missing resource limits

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bounded event processing with LRU eviction
- [ ] Memory growth limits enforced
- [ ] Backpressure handling implemented
- [ ] Memory leak tests verify stable usage
- [ ] Performance under high-frequency changes tested
- [ ] Resource cleanup on errors verified
