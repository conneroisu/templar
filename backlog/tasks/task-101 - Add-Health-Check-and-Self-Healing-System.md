## Description

The system lacks comprehensive health monitoring and self-healing capabilities, making it difficult to detect and recover from component failures in production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Health check framework with configurable checks
- [x] Self-healing mechanisms for critical components
- [x] Monitoring integration for health status
- [x] Automated recovery actions for common failures
- [x] Health dashboard and alerting system

## Implementation Plan

1. Audit existing health monitoring infrastructure
2. Identify gaps in self-healing capabilities  
3. Design self-healing system with recovery actions
4. Implement automated recovery rules for common failures
5. Create health dashboard for real-time monitoring
6. Integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems
7. Test self-healing mechanisms under various failure scenarios
8. Document recovery procedures and dashboard usage

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Health Check and Self-Healing System that builds upon the existing robust health monitoring infrastructure. This advanced system provides automated recovery capabilities and real-time dashboard monitoring.

### Existing Infrastructure Discovery

The codebase already contained sophisticated health monitoring components:

#### 1. **CLI Health Command** (`cmd/health.go`)
- Comprehensive health check CLI with HTTP server, filesystem, build tools, and component directory validation
- Configurable timeouts, hosts, ports with verbose output options
- Docker health check integration and deployment readiness probes

#### 2. **Advanced Health Monitor** (`internal/monitoring/health.go`)
- **HealthMonitor** with concurrent health check execution and result caching
- **Predefined Health Checkers**: Filesystem, memory usage, goroutine leak detection
- **HTTP Handler** with proper status codes (200/503) based on health status
- **Rich Health Response** with system info, uptime, check summaries, and metadata

#### 3. **Alerting System** (`internal/monitoring/alerting.go`)
- **Alert levels**: Info, Warning, Critical with comprehensive alert metadata
- **AlertRule configuration** with conditions, thresholds, and duration settings
- **Alert management** with deduplication, counting, and time-based tracking

### New Self-Healing Components Implemented

#### 1. **SelfHealingSystem** (`internal/monitoring/selfhealing.go`)
- **RecoveryAction Interface**: Pluggable recovery actions with execution context
- **RecoveryRule Configuration**: Configurable failure thresholds, timeouts, cooldown periods
- **Recovery History Tracking**: Detailed tracking of recovery attempts and success rates
- **Concurrent Recovery Execution**: Thread-safe recovery with proper timeout handling

#### 2. **Advanced Recovery Actions** (`internal/monitoring/selfhealing_integration.go`)
- **Component-Specific Actions**: Build pipeline restart, component registry refresh, file watcher recovery
- **System-Level Actions**: Garbage collection, temporary file cleanup, goroutine stack dumps
- **Smart Cooldown Logic**: Prevents recovery storms with configurable cooldown periods
- **Context-Aware Execution**: Proper timeout and cancellation handling

#### 3. **Health Dashboard** (`internal/monitoring/dashboard.go`)
- **Real-Time Web Interface**: Live health status monitoring with auto-refresh
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Health check status, system metrics, recovery history display
- **RESTful API**: JSON endpoints for health data and recovery information
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded health status with detailed metadata

#### 4. **Integration Framework** (`internal/monitoring/integration_helpers.go`)
- **ComprehensiveHealthSystem**: Unified health monitoring and self-healing coordination
- **Default Recovery Rules**: Pre-configured recovery rules for common failure scenarios
- **HTTP Handler Integration**: Seamless integration with existing server infrastructure
- **Extensibility Support**: Custom health checks and recovery rule registration

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Self-Healing Architecture
```go
// Recovery rule example for memory issues
{
    CheckName:           "memory",
    MinFailureCount:     2,           // Trigger after 2 consecutive failures
    RecoveryTimeout:     30 * time.Second,
    CooldownPeriod:      5 * time.Minute,
    MaxRecoveryAttempts: 3,
    Actions: []RecoveryAction{
        LoggingAction(logger),        // Log detailed failure information
        GarbageCollectAction(),       // Force garbage collection
        WaitAction(5 * time.Second),  // Allow system stabilization
    },
}
```

#### Recovery Action Types
- **RestartServiceAction**: Restart failed services with proper lifecycle management
- **ClearCacheAction**: Clear component caches to resolve build issues
- **GarbageCollectAction**: Force garbage collection for memory pressure
- **CleanTemporaryFilesAction**: Clean up temporary files to free disk space
- **RefreshComponentRegistryAction**: Rescan component directories
- **RestartFileWatcherAction**: Restart file system monitoring

#### Health Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds with manual refresh capability
- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, goroutine count, GC statistics, uptime tracking
- **Recovery Tracking**: Visual representation of recovery attempts and success rates
- **Status Visualization**: Color-coded health indicators (✅ healthy, ⚠️ degraded, ❌ unhealthy)

### Integration Achievements

#### 1. **Seamless Integration**
- Built upon existing `HealthMonitor` and `AlertManager` infrastructure
- Extended existing `/health` endpoint functionality
- Added new dashboard endpoints: `/health-dashboard`, `/health-dashboard/api/*`
- Integrated with existing logging and monitoring systems

#### 2. **Production-Ready Features**
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All concurrent access protected by appropriate mutexes
- **Resource Management**: Proper goroutine lifecycle and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery with detailed logging
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient health check execution and result caching

#### 3. **Extensibility**
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add custom health checks and recovery actions
- **Configuration-Driven**: Recovery rules configurable per deployment environment
- **Monitoring Integration**: Works with existing Prometheus/OpenTelemetry systems
