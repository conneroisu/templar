## Description

Several critical packages lack comprehensive test coverage, including internal/build/compiler.go, internal/build/cache.go, and plugin systems, creating potential reliability and security risks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage for internal/build/compiler.go with security validation
- [ ] Unit tests for internal/build/cache.go LRU implementation
- [ ] Integration tests for plugin system loading and isolation
- [ ] Security tests for command injection prevention
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for cache and compiler operations
