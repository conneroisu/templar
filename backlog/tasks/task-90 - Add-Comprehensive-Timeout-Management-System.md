## Description

Operations throughout the codebase lack consistent timeout handling, leading to potential indefinite blocking on long-running operations like file scanning, builds, and WebSocket connections.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Context-based timeouts for all long-running operations
- [ ] Configurable timeout values through configuration system
- [ ] Proper cancellation handling in build pipeline
- [ ] Timeout implementation for file scanning operations
- [ ] WebSocket connection timeout improvements
