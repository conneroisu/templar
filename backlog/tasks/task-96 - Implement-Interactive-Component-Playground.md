## Description

The current component preview system is static and lacks interactive capabilities for testing different props and states, limiting the development and testing experience for component authors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interactive prop editing interface in web UI
- [ ] Real-time component re-rendering with prop changes
- [ ] Enhanced mock data generation with contextual awareness
- [ ] Code generation display for current component state
- [ ] Integration with existing preview server architecture
