## Description

High-priority reliability issue where build requests are silently dropped when queues are full, causing silent failures without user notification. This affects system reliability under load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace silent queue dropping with backpressure handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic or priority-based queue management
- [ ] Add proper error reporting for dropped requests
- [ ] Ensure no build requests are lost silently
- [ ] Add monitoring for queue overflow scenarios

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive queue overflow protection with backpressure handling. Key changes: 1) Replaced silent queue dropping with explicit error logging and metrics, 2) Added non-blocking sends to prevent worker deadlocks, 3) Implemented retry logic with priority queue promotion, 4) Added queue health monitoring with detailed metrics, 5) Enhanced BuildMetrics with DroppedTasks/DroppedResults tracking. Tests validate proper handling of task queue, priority queue, and results queue overflow scenarios.
