## Description

When components fail to render or build, the system lacks fallback mechanisms to provide alternative functionality or graceful degradation of features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fallback rendering for failed components
- [ ] Component error boundary implementation
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies for build failures
- [ ] Alternative functionality when components are unavailable
- [ ] User-friendly error displays with recovery options
