## Description

Carol (UX Agent) identified HIGH-severity configuration UX issues where the wizard overwhelms users with too many options upfront, causing abandonment. Users need progressive disclosure and quick start presets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement Quick Start and Advanced wizard modes
- [ ] Quick Start asks only essential questions
- [ ] Add configuration presets (minimal blog dashboard)
- [ ] Advanced options discoverable later
- [ ] Configuration validation provides actionable feedback
- [ ] Inline comments explain all configuration options
