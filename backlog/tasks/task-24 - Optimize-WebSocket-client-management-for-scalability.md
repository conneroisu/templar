## Description

WebSocket broadcasting has quadratic complexity with failed client cleanup and lacks connection pooling, causing performance degradation with many clients

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement indexed client tracking instead of linear scans
- [ ] Add connection pooling and reuse mechanisms
- [ ] Implement async client cleanup for failed connections
- [ ] Add per-IP rate limiting for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Benchmark performance with 100+ concurrent clients
- [ ] Add connection lifecycle monitoring

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current WebSocket client management bottlenecks in server/websocket.go
2. Implement indexed client tracking with sync.Map for O(1) operations
3. Add connection pooling with proper goroutine lifecycle management
4. Implement async failed client cleanup with worker pool
5. Add per-IP rate limiting with configurable limits
6. Create comprehensive benchmarks for 100+ concurrent clients
7. Add connection lifecycle monitoring with metrics
8. Optimize broadcast algorithm to avoid quadratic complexity
