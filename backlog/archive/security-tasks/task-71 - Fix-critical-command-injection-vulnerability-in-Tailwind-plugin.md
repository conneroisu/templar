## Description

The Tailwind plugin contains critical command injection vulnerabilities where user input is passed directly to shell commands without proper sanitization. This poses a security risk that could allow arbitrary command execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Command injection vulnerability in tailwind.go line 268 is fixed
- [ ] Shell command usage replaced with native Go file operations
- [ ] Security tests added to prevent regression
- [ ] Code review confirms no remaining shell injection points

## Implementation Notes

Command injection vulnerability has been resolved. The tailwind.go file now includes proper input sanitization, secure temporary file creation using os.CreateTemp, path validation to prevent traversal attacks, and safe file operations replacing shell commands with native Go operations.
