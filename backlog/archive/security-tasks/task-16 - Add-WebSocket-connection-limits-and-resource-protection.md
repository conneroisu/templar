## Description

No connection limits on WebSocket endpoints could allow resource exhaustion attacks. Implement connection limits and resource protection mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WebSocket connection limits implemented
- [x] Resource exhaustion protection added
- [x] Connection cleanup mechanisms enhanced
- [x] DoS protection validated through testing
- [x] Performance maintained under normal loads

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current WebSocket server implementation in internal/server/
2. Design connection limit architecture with configurable limits
3. Implement connection tracking with concurrent-safe counters
4. Add resource protection mechanisms (memory limits, cleanup)
5. Create graceful connection rejection for over-limit scenarios
6. Add comprehensive testing for DoS scenarios and normal operations
7. Update configuration system with WebSocket limits
8. Document security measures and operational considerations

## Implementation Notes

WebSocket connection limits and resource protection are already comprehensively implemented. The existing implementation includes:

1. **Global connection limit**: 100 concurrent connections maximum
2. **Per-IP connection limit**: 20 connections per IP address  
3. **Message rate limiting**: 60 messages per minute per client with sliding window algorithm
4. **Resource protection**: 512-byte message size limit, 5-minute connection timeout
5. **DoS protection**: Origin validation, connection flooding protection, protocol attack prevention
6. **Async cleanup**: Dedicated cleanup workers with proper resource management
7. **Comprehensive testing**: Security, performance, and edge case validation

The implementation exceeds the acceptance criteria with enterprise-grade security features including per-IP tracking, sliding window rate limiting, and extensive attack prevention measures. All security and performance tests validate the robustness of the protection mechanisms.
