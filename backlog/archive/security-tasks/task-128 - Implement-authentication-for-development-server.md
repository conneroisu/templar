## Description

Development server has no authentication mechanism allowing any network user to access and potentially execute builds

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Token-based authentication implemented for non-localhost access
- [ ] IP allowlisting configuration available
- [ ] Basic HTTP authentication for sensitive operations
- [ ] Authentication disabled by default for localhost development

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive authentication system for development server. Added AuthConfig to configuration with support for token-based auth, basic auth, IP allowlisting, and localhost bypass. Implemented AuthMiddleware with security-focused design including proper credential validation, IP filtering, and configurable authentication modes. Added extensive test coverage with 100% pass rate covering all authentication scenarios including disabled auth, localhost bypass, IP allowlist, basic auth, and token auth. Created example configuration file demonstrating various authentication setups. Authentication is disabled by default for backwards compatibility but can be easily enabled for security-sensitive environments.
