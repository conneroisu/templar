## Description

Path validation only checks against current working directory and lacks symlink attack protection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Symlinks resolved before path validation using filepath.EvalSymlinks()
- [ ] Explicit symlink detection and handling implemented
- [ ] Security tests verify symlink attacks are blocked
- [ ] Path traversal protection covers all edge cases
