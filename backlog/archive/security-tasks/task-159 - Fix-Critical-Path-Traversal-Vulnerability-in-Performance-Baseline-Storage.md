## Description

The performance regression detection system contains a critical path traversal vulnerability that allows writing baseline files outside the intended directory structure, potentially compromising system security.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- [x] Baseline directory creation is restricted to current working directory
- [x] File operations validate all paths before execution
- [x] Security tests prevent regression of path traversal fixes
- [x] Integration with existing validation package is complete

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current path handling in baseline operations
2. Implement centralized path validation using existing validation package
3. Add working directory restriction for baseline storage
4. Update file operations to use validated paths
5. Create comprehensive security tests for path traversal prevention
6. Integrate with existing security testing framework
7. Add validation for edge cases (symlinks, relative paths, URL encoding)

## Implementation Notes

**Approach Taken:**
- Implemented comprehensive path validation using the existing `internal/validation` package
- Added `validateBaselineDirectory()` function with multi-layer security checks
- Enhanced file operations with path validation and restrictive permissions
- Created extensive security test suite to prevent regression

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Path Traversal Prevention**: `detector.go:423-461` - `validateBaselineDirectory()` function
   - Uses `validation.ValidatePath()` for initial validation
   - Ensures baseline directory is within current working directory
   - Prevents parent directory traversal with relative path checking
   - Validates absolute paths against current working directory

2. **Enhanced File Security**: `detector.go:464-489` - `saveBaseline()` function
   - Added path validation for all file operations
   - Changed file permissions from 0644 to 0600 (owner-only read/write)
   - Changed directory permissions from 0755 to 0700 (owner-only access)
   - Sanitizes filenames to prevent injection attacks

3. **Integration Points**: `detector.go:175-178` - `UpdateBaselines()` function
   - Validates baseline directory before any file operations
   - Fails fast on security violations

4. **Comprehensive Security Tests**: `detector_security_test.go` - 186 lines of security tests
   - Path traversal attack simulation and prevention
   - Dangerous character filtering validation
   - File permission security verification
   - Symlink attack prevention
   - Edge case handling (empty names, shell injection attempts)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers (validation package + custom checks)
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Operations fail if any security check fails
- **Restrictive Permissions**: 0600/0700 permissions instead of 0644/0755
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tests updated to use relative paths

**Modified Files:**
- `internal/performance/detector.go`: Added security validation functions and integration
- `internal/performance/detector_security_test.go`: New comprehensive security test suite  
- `internal/performance/detector_test.go`: Updated existing tests to use relative paths

**Security Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates path traversal vulnerabilities completely
- ✅ Prevents writing files outside current working directory
- ✅ Blocks access to system directories (/etc, /proc, /sys, etc.)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage prevents security regression
- ✅ Maintains performance while adding security layers
