## Description

Medium-priority security vulnerability where SanitizeInput function only removes control characters but doesn't handle encoding attacks, potentially allowing bypass of input validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement comprehensive input sanitization including HTML encoding
- [ ] Add URL decoding validation
- [ ] Prevent encoding-based attack vectors
- [ ] Add security tests for encoding attack scenarios
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Document sanitization behavior
