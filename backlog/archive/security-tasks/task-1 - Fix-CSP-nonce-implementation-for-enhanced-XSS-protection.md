## Description

Current CSP allows unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval in development mode which could enable XSS attacks. Implement nonce-based CSP for better security.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CSP uses nonces instead of unsafe-inline
- [ ] CSP uses nonces instead of unsafe-eval
- [ ] Development mode maintains functionality with nonce-based CSP
- [ ] XSS protection validated through security tests

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Notes

**Approach taken**: The CSP nonce implementation was already excellently implemented in the codebase. The task involved analyzing the existing implementation and fixing outdated tests that expected unsafe directives.

**Features implemented or modified**:
1. ✅ Verified nonce generation uses cryptographically secure random values (16 bytes, base64 encoded)
2. ✅ Confirmed CSP headers properly filter out unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval when nonces are provided  
3. ✅ Validated HTML templates include nonces in script and style tags via RenderComponentWithLayoutAndNonce
4. ✅ Fixed test expectations to reflect improved security posture using nonces instead of unsafe directives

**Technical decisions and trade-offs**:
- Both development and production modes now use nonce-based CSP by default (EnableNonce = true)
- This provides better security than the previous approach which relied on unsafe directives in development
- Updated tests to validate the improved security model rather than legacy unsafe directive usage

**Modified or added files**:
- : Fixed TestDevelopmentVsProductionCSP to expect nonce usage
- : Updated TestSecurityMiddleware_DevelopmentConfig to validate nonce-based approach

**Security validation**:
- All CSP and XSS security tests pass, including comprehensive XSS attack pattern validation
- Nonce uniqueness verified across multiple requests  
- Integration between security middleware, nonce generation, and HTML rendering confirmed working
