## Description

Critical security vulnerability in Tailwind plugin where configPath parameter can be exploited for command injection attacks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Config paths validated using validation.ValidatePath() before use
- [ ] Command arguments use strict allowlisting only
- [ ] Security tests verify injection attempts are blocked
- [ ] Path validation includes symlink resolution

## Implementation Notes

Successfully remediated command injection vulnerability in Tailwind plugin by implementing comprehensive input validation. Added ValidatePath() and ValidateArgument() validation for configPath parameter before use in command arguments. Implemented command allowlisting to prevent unauthorized command execution. Added comprehensive security tests that verify injection attempts are blocked including path traversal, command injection with various metacharacters, and unauthorized commands. All security tests pass confirming the vulnerability is fixed.
