## Description

The Tailwind plugin uses shell commands with user-controlled input that allows command injection attacks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace shell echo command with os.WriteFile()
- [ ] Replace shell rm command with os.Remove()
- [ ] Add input sanitization for CSS content
- [ ] Test command injection prevention

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze command injection vulnerabilities in /internal/plugins/builtin/tailwind.go:268,297\n2. Replace shell echo command with os.WriteFile() for CSS content\n3. Replace shell rm command with os.Remove() for file cleanup\n4. Add input sanitization for CSS content before processing\n5. Create security tests to validate command injection prevention\n6. Run security scan to confirm vulnerability resolution

## Implementation Notes

Successfully fixed critical command injection vulnerabilities in Tailwind plugin:

✅ Replaced shell echo command with os.WriteFile() for secure file creation
✅ Replaced shell rm command with os.Remove() for secure file cleanup  
✅ Replaced shell cat command with os.ReadFile() for secure file reading
✅ Replaced shell test command with os.Stat() for file existence checks
✅ Added comprehensive input sanitization removing shell metacharacters and dangerous command patterns
✅ Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
✅ Enhanced security with os.CreateTemp() for secure temporary file creation
✅ Added comprehensive security tests validating command injection prevention
✅ Added path traversal protection tests
✅ All security tests passing - vulnerability eliminated

The Tailwind plugin now uses only secure native Go file operations and comprehensive input validation, completely eliminating the command injection attack vectors.
