        # ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Vulnerability Reporting
        
        **IMPORTANT**: For serious security vulnerabilities, please consider using private reporting instead of creating a public issue.
        
        If this is a critical security issue that could be exploited, please:
        1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
        2. Or email the maintainers directly
        3. Allow reasonable time for patching before public disclosure
        
        For general security improvements or low-risk issues, you may use this template.
